## 2. Architecture

The following diagram shows the Leopold OTC staging environment. Within the IHK Munich (green box), there are 
three OpenEthereum nodes that represent the actual blockchain. Two of these nodes are validator nodes, namely 
Host 1 and 2. A third node serves only as an API interface, providing an RPC interface to the outside, namely 
Host 3. All other software components are used for monitoring the Leopold blockchain.
